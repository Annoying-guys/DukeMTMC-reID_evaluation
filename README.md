#DukeMTMC_evaluation
[DukeMTMC](http://vision.cs.duke.edu/DukeMTMC/) is a large-scale video dataset for person tracking in  multiple cameras. For person re-ID evaluation, I extract the frames and split the training and test set.
Here is the evaluation code.

#Evaluation
Change the feature path in the `evaluation_res_duke_fast.m` and run it.

I will provide the image dataset after ICCV submission.
